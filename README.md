# cyber-information-operations
An updated compilation of tools, frameworks, references, and papers relating to cyber deception, counterintelligence, and PSYOPS. Aims to serve as a place to dissect previous lessons learned, determine current solutions, and choose future solutions and research direction.

*author's personal note/thoughts/rant*

In my humble opinion, there's an awful lot of "hand wringing" in the field of cyber deception. Too many people speak from a high level on deception technology, but they often like to use safe blanket statements like "it's worth looking into" or "you should deploy honeypots" - so on and so forth. It drives me nuts because cyber deception is a massively untapped field of defense that can do a lot of good and change the way that defenders can **protect themselves.** 

This repository aims to put together every tool and resource that's "out there." There isn't a large concentration on research and development, so it can be frustrating for those interested to find a comprehensive list of solutions. I know it was frustrating for me. Try exploring these resources!
