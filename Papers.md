*author's note:* 
I, admittedly, have some bias to my favorite readings. Barton Whaley and Kimberly Ferguson-Walter are by far my favorite deception-related authors. Please explore a variety of readings from a variety of authors during your research to paint the most detailed picture possible of current efforts.

# S-Type (Sensory)

# C-Type (Countersensory)

- [ACyDS: An adaptive cyber deception system](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7795427) - Detailing the theory behind a moving-target network defense using OpenFlow.

# D-Type (Deceptive)

- ["Tularosa Study"](https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/imposing-cyber-penalty-against-attackers-cyber-deception ) - examining efficacy of cyber deception in environment against various experts in offensive security. Based on Moonraker study.
- [Appendix to "Tularosa Study"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372160277_Appendix_to_The_Tularosa_Study_An_Experimental_Design_and_Implementation_to_Quantify_the_Effectiveness_of_Cyber_Deception) - design and implementation of the Tularosa Study, including the questionnaire given to participating red teamers.
- [Examining the Efficacy of Decoy-based and Psychological Cyber Deception](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/ferguson-walter) - Follow up to the Tularosa study. The original TS paper discusses the design and implementation of the study, this paper discusses the findings and takeaways.
- [Friend or Faux: Deception for Cyber Defense](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330425001_Friend_or_Faux_Deception_for_Cyber_Defense) - "sets the stage" for the later Tularosa Study. Interesting reading, but mainly acknowledges deception/information operations as a discipline and outlines techniques without going into much depth or establishing empirical baselines.
- ["Moonraker Study"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337464633_The_Moonraker_Study_An_Experimental_Evaluation_of_Host-Based_Deception) - also examining efficacy. Performed in military setting and focuses more on emotional response.
- [The Case for Unpredictability and Deception as OS Features](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_aug15_03_sun.pdf) - An interesting paper from 2015 regarding OS API design. Attempts to combat malware and automated attacks by introducing "uncertainty" into an operating system. The PoC, an OS called Chameleon, didn't end up being fully developed.
- [Towards a Cognitive Theory of Cyber Deception](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cogs.13013) - Applying game theory (Stackelberg security games) to the risk/reward model of interacting with deception.

# P-Type (Psychological)

- [Frustration, confusion, surprise, confidence, and self-doubt: Cyber operators' affects during a realistic experiment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374870776_Frustration_confusion_surprise_confidence_and_self-doubt_Cyber_operators'_affects_during_a_realistic_experiment) - Ferguson-Walter's analysis of emotional response from red teamers during engagements. Shows how psychological effects can be measured and associated with action.
- [Remote Sensing, Inference, and Intelligence in the Information Environment](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/151905) - Provides a means of quantifying the spread of mis/disinformation online (very cool!) For the purposes of CBaD, this paper provides a useful model of the evolution of social information in an adversarial (influence campaign) context.
- [Loss-aversion or loss-attention: The impact of losses on cognitive performance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010028512000898) - Argues that cognition (ergo action) is impacted when someone perceives a potentially substantial loss.
- [Emotion and perception: the role of affective information](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22039565/) - Emotion and its direction (positive/negative) impact perception on reality. Probably emotion impacts cognition which impacts actions (like sensory actions, such as perception.)
- [The Lure of Counterfactual Curiosity: People Incur a Cost to Experience Regret](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620963615) - People are willing to go so far as to incur some kind of cost in order to find out information. Especially when it's about themselves.
- [Curiosity and the desire for agency: wait, wait… don’t tell me!](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-021-00330-0) - See above - "Lure of Counterfactual Curiosity"

# Signaling Theory

- [Signals in Social Supernets](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00394.x) - Discussion of how social networking sites change social interaction and signaling. Fundamental building block of social and emotional influence. By J. Donath
- [Urbanhermes: social signaling with electronic fashion](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1124772.1124902) - Demonstrating signaling online through new, electronic forms of "fashion" (like updating your status on Twitter, posting on Instagram, etc.) Also co-authored by Donath.

# Generic Cybercriminal Profile
- [Dimensions of Cyber-Attacks: Cultural, Social, Economic, and Political](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5725605) - Describes cybercriminal motivations as falling under three main categories: political, economical, and socio-cultural.
